# Securing Kubernetes
Open source software has many benefits, but unfortunately it is more suspectible to security attacks given its open nature. Kubernetes is no exception. Look no further than [RedLock's report](https://redlock.io/blog/cryptojacking-tesla) on how hackers infiltrated Aviva and Gemalto's Kubernetes clusters to mine cryptocurriencies. Even Tesla had insecure Kubernetes dashboard open to the internet, which contained credentials to its AWS environment. 

Leverege recommends working with a security company to harden and secure your Kubernetes cluster, but here is a list of best practices to fix the common issues. 

## Managed Services 
An added benefit to using a managed Kubernetes service is that the service provider handles most of the security issues for you. For example, [GKE manages the Kubernetes control plane](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/security-overview) (API server, scheduler, controller manager, and etcd) and addresses some of the CIS Kubernetes benchmarks by default. 

The default configuration is frequently insecure for production. The good news is that fixing most of these vulnerabilities is a matter of clicking a button on the UI. [CIS Google Cloud Platform benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/google_cloud_computing_platform/) lists 18 different configurations with regards to Kubernetes. Most are enabled by default (Stackdriver logging/monitoring, using COS as the node image, *etc.*) and others are addressed by simply enabling automatic node repairs and upgrades. 

Google also provides [further instructions](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/hardening-your-cluster) on hardening the cluster's security by adding network and pod security policies for granular control. 

## CIS Kubernetes Benchmarks
CIS also provides [a list of benchmarks for Kubernetes](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/) separately. As mentioned above, a managed service will address most of these benchmarks, but if you are managing your own Kubernetes cluster, you can use these guidelines to secure the master and worker nodes. 

Fortunately, the folks at Aqua Security open sourced a tool to run checks automatically against these benchmarks. You can run [kube-bench](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench) on the cluster to generate a report along with recommended remediation steps.
